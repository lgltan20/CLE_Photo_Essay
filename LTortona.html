        <h1>Poor in Spirit</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-12">by Lance Tortona</h5>

<p class="w3-text-grey">The person in this photo is Mar, the main breadwinner of his family and a father of 3 children. He works as a sari-sari store vendor, and although he has not hit rock bottom is is still able to provide for his family with three meals a day, he is still less fortunate than most of everybody around him. He says that he is poor not because of a lack of effort or such - rather, he is poor, he says, because he was born into it. Poverty, he says, is something that’s very easy to enter but hard to get out of. A single person that gets into poverty can keep many generations trapped inside it: this is known as a poverty trap. In that sense I came to realize that poverty is not wholly the fault of the poor in question, but rather, poverty is more of a structural fault - a societal sin, in other words. The entire reason that poverty exists is due to societal imbalance: the rich tend to hoard money, leaving the less fortunate members of society lacking.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">He agrees that the rich also tend to feel disconnected from the plight of the poor, in the sense that often they believe opinions along the line of “the only reason that poor people are poor is because they aren’t working as hard as they should.” I brought the fact that rich people sometimes do this up with Mar and he agreed with me that these people are misguided. However, he says, he does not blame them for their opinions, as obviously they can’t really know the struggle of poverty to the extent that actual poor people do without experiencing it firsthand. These people have had most of their life handed to them on a silver platter, so they would naturally have no experience of how poverty actually feels like. Despite this, Mar still wishes that instead of helping from a distance through works like charity and donation, the rich would find it in themselves to help instead by visiting the poor firsthand and interacting with them. Mar argues that in-person interaction makes it easier to believe that the rich are genuinely concerned about them instead of only donating to preserve face in front of society.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">In addition to his opinion on the rich, I also asked him about how and where religion fits into his life. He said that he was a devout Catholic, and he made it a point to pray every day and attend Mass every week. By talking with him I found that he was more serious in his faith than most people I knew, and this surprised me, as my initial assumption was that the poor would have less faith in God, as they might feel feelings of abandonment towards Him for being dealt a bad hand in life. When I asked him why he felt so strongly religious, he said something simple, but at the same time profound: “When nobody else is willing to support you, God is the only one you can lean on.” The statement made it immediately clear to me why oftentimes festivals like the Black Nazarene are attended by so many people, and also why the Church has as much power in the nation as it does. Due to the rampant problem of poverty in the Philippines, people are less inclined to bother fixing it, and as such, most poor people are shunned by the rich. It is easy to see that their faith is their only pillar of stability in society.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">Ironically, even though Mar says that the reason he’s working this hard is because of God, it is in fact easy to find God in the way he carries himself through life. It might even be a stretch to say that it is easy to find God in every poor person there is. When one is materially poor, they also tend to be spiritually poor: they are more often than not humble and place complete reliance in what God can do for them. Unlike people who are blinded by material wealth and as such tend to forget who gives them their blessings in the first place, the spiritually poor never forget that ultimately, it is God who gives them their blessings and it is God who takes them away as He sees fit. They find God in all aspects of their lives, whether good or bad or in between. One could say that they embody one of the core tenets of Ignatian Spirituality, that is, to find God in all things.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">My short chat and interview with Mar has really opened my eyes to how the poor view life. In truth, they are far from being people we should not strive to emulate, rather, we must be able to make ourselves poor in spirit as well, just like as Jesus said in the Beatitudes.</p>
