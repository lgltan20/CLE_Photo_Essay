        <h1>God's Presence</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-12">by Wil Uy</h5>

<p class="w3-text-grey">Often times, when we think of God’s presence it’s hinged on blessings; good times where there is prosperity, wealth and abundance. But then when tragedy strikes, it becomes a struggle and burden to have faith and not blame God for all of our misfortunes. Featured in the image to the right is Nanay Gemilin, a mother of 5  she has to work multiple jobs along side her husband to keep food on the table everyday. While they may have daily financial struggles, they always find time to pray as evident by the miniature statues of saints present in their house. Having migrated from the province, Nanay Gemilin originally came to Metro Manila seeking a better life for herself. While talking to her, she narrated the difference of how in the province everyone looked out for each other as compared to the metro where a “shark eats shark” mentality is present. Having moved to Metro Manila in her youth, a blissful decision, she ended up leaving her first child back in her home province and hopes one day to be able to return to her child and apologize for her absence. While she greatly desires to go and visit her first born, she expressed her inability to get enough money to make the journey. A cost amounting to around two thousand pesos or so for a one way trip, for an average person living in the metro it would seem meager as compared to the expenses faced on a daily basis. This brings to light the privilege many of us face. While two thousand means the world to Nanay Gemilin, we often find ourselves spending the same amount unknowingly. Unable to access cheaper produce from the wet market and allocate funds to transportation to find higher paying jobs, Nanay Gemilin experiences what is commonly known as the “poverty trap” where by no fault of her own her life style is more costly. Not only do we have more to spend, but the access we have to cheaper products also allows us to save a great deal more. This information is essential to understanding the situation of the poor. While many with money have the perception of working hard and smart to gain success, in reality that is merely a misconception. People blame the “mentality of the poor” on their hardships yet how can we judge others when we ourselves have never had to go through their true experiences? Based on my interaction with Nanay Gemilin unlike what is commonly thought of the poor, she in fact is lively and holds her values to a high regard. She discussed with me of how her greatest dreams are that her children become good citizens of society by doing their own good little deeds. Simply put, this shows how one does not need much to be able to feel God’s presence and especially his guidance. Despite the struggle faced by her family, through her faith and belief in God, she seeks guidance as to how to raise her children not with the priority of monetary success but instead with that of finding a purpose to aid others who may face the same dire situation as her.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">Aside from Nanay Gemilin’s ability to over come the weight of poverty to see God, I too through my experience with her was able to gain a deeper understanding of the phrase “to see God in all things.”  While initially believing that I would be the medium of God sharing my material wealth to someone less fortunate, I too found God through my interaction. First, God was present in their willingness to interact with me. Simply put, while we more privileged have our misconceptions and stigmas against those in impoverished communities, stigmas also exist about us being snobbish, ignorant or spoiled. Despite what the initial perception could have been, Nanay Gemilin welcomed my presence with open arms and never excluded me from a snack despite knowing that I didn’t need it and had the ability to purchase one for myself after the interaction. Secondly, God was present to me through the little activities that sparked joy. They say that “happiness is contagious” and that was no exception in my interaction with Nanay Gemiline and her family. In my interaction with her at one point I had played with one of her children and the other kids present in the area. Despite not having much materially to be able to play with, they still found very simple games to find joy in. In these simple games I was able to see God as while God may be known to be apparent in wealth, it became easy to see him in simplicity. Through simplicity with every complex part cut away, God then was clearer to me as there was no distraction between him and the joy I was able to experience with and through the children. Finally I found God in this experience with the gained knowledge and empathy I was able to derive from my interaction. While I thank God for the material wealth I have, this interaction gave wealth unmeasurable by money that of a deeper understanding of others. With this came new perspectives and optimism rarely seen especially in those who have wealth. I saw God in the persistence and principles given by Nanay Gemiline who despite the struggle showed me that there is hope for a better tomorrow. By giving me the opportunity to interact with people of a different background God became apparent through multiple aspects of the experience.</p>

<p class="w3-text-grey">To conclude, to find God in a multitude of manners when interacting I recommend an open mind and heart. The key to new perspectives and the ability to search for God was that of letting go and lowering my walls to allow God to also come to me through the unique interaction. While we may have our expectations, a balance must be stuck of allowing yourself to fully be part of the experience. In everything God may be found, we just have to do the work of reading through the lines and reflecting on what has come. </p>
