<p class="w3-text-grey">The person in this photo is Shirley Llaneta. She is a current house maid who helps in cleaning around the house. Her background before she became a house maid was that she lived far away from Manila and she had two brothers. Her father was a farmer and her mother was a housemaid. Her mother had to work away from her family because her father could not earn enough money to support all of them. This lead to her mother working away. But during the times her mother visited her, she would cherish these experiences and enjoy it. Some time has passed and she worked along side her father until he unfortunately passed away. Following this, she had several arguments with her brothers on what to do with the land so she left the family. During this time she married her husband. His job was a construction worker. However, the money he earned from his job is not enough to support the both of them. This lead him to crash and start blaming Shirley for the money problems instead of working together to find a solution. What Shirley decided to do was to work as a house maid in their local area to try and earn some money for them to use. Despite Shirley working daily for 12 hours, her husband still thinks the amount of work she is contributing is still not enough to support the both of them. So this lead to an abusive relationship where Shirley’s husband would use domestic violence on a daily basis. It reach up until Shirley decided to live with her aunt for the time being until she could decide what to do. She waited for a month and made the decision to stay as a house helper but move to Manila to do it. She became a house maid and worked for herself, no longer for her abusive husband, whom she decided to never contact again.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">This story of poverty is really unfortunate to hear. You could see her efforts in trying to escape it but the people around her are not very supportive of it or their methods of motivation are unethical. However, despite these circumstances she said that she will try her best tor remain happy and be grateful for what she has right now. Her reason for this is that she is a strong believer of being humble for what you posses. From this, you could say that she has lived her life in a life of poverty. She was not very fortunate when she was young and had people around her drag her down and keep her in this level. But what separates her from other people is her heart. She is not poor of heart because of her humbleness and her strive to remain happy and thankful for the things she has.</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">I asked her what she thought about poverty and she said that it is unavoidable. Everywhere you go there would always be poverty. But what said is that poverty could not be erased but could be reduced. How this may be possible is to change the attitudes of the people who are currently struggling. She said that people who are in poverty tend to give up and always blame others. She is speaking from experience based on what her husband did to her. People need to have a positive attitude. More in the lines of “I can do it”, much like what she had. She said she would always tell people, helping starts with yourself.</p>
