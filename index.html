      <h5 class="w3-padding-12">by Lance Tan</h5>

<p class="w3-text-grey">2018 has come and gone, and as we enter the new year, I realize, things have not changed. Global warming is still a heavily pressing issue, I am still studying and going through each day in a daze, simply waiting for what comes next (another day of exams or projects I would assume) and looking around, the world has not progressed much. The elections are soon approaching, bringing with it many promises of wealth to the poor, help to those in need. However, there really is not much of that happening.</p>

            <p class="w3-text-grey">The person in this photo is Shirley Llaneta. She is a current house maid who helps in cleaning around the house. Her background before she became a house maid was that she lived far away from Manila and she had two brothers. Her father was a farmer and her mother was a housemaid. Her mother had to work away from her family because her father could not earn enough money to support all of them. This lead to her mother working away...</p>

            <p class="w3-text-grey">The person in this photo is Mar, the main breadwinner of his family and a father of 3 children. He works as a sari-sari store vendor, and although he has not hit rock bottom is is still able to provide for his family with three meals a day, he is still less fortunate than most of everybody around him. He says that he is poor not because of a lack of effort or such - rather, he is poor, he says, because he was born into it. Poverty, he says, is something that’s very easy to enter but hard to get out of...</p>

            <h1>God's Presence</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-12">by Wil Uy</h5>
            
            <p class="w3-text-grey">Often times, when we think of God’s presence it’s hinged on blessings; good times where there is prosperity, wealth and abundance. But then when tragedy strikes, it becomes a struggle and burden to have faith and not blame God for all of our misfortunes. Featured in the image to the right is Nanay Gemilin, a mother of 5  she has to work multiple jobs along side her husband to keep food on the table everyday. While they may have daily financial struggles, they always find time to pray as evident by the miniature statues of saints present in their house...</p>
